# WorldDev

Starter kit for building World Mini Apps.

[next-world-auth](https://www.npmjs.com/package/next-world-auth) is a package that offers authentication and payment abstraction for World mini apps. In a few lines of code, you have a miniapp with persistent sessions that can be deployed and added to the [World App Store](https://world.org/ecosystem).

The API is currently unstable and may change without notice. 

## Usage

The package has been designed to make it as easy as possible to add authentication to your mini app. You need to:

1. Add the package to your project
2. Wrap your app with the `WorldAuthProvider`
3. Use the `useWorldAuth()` hook
4. If you want to use signInWorldID(), a few environment variables needs to be set for the callback URL and the secret key

```typescript
import { useWorldAuth } from 'next-world-auth/react'

export default function Home() {
  const { isInstalled,
          isAuthenticated,
          session,
          signInWorldID,
          signInWallet,
          signOut,
          getLocation } = useWorldAuth()

  return (<>
    ...
  </>)
}
```
The `session` value is of type `Session | null`. Refer to this [file](https://github.com/gip/worlddev/tree/main/next-world-auth/src/types.ts) for more information.
